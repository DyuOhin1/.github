隨著時代變遷與技術發展，學校學生資訊系統經歷多次升級與改版，導致新舊系統分散於不同平台，造成使用不便。
> As technology advances, student information systems in schools have been upgraded multiple times, leading to old and new systems being spread across different platforms, making them hard to use.

本專題旨在統一並重製學生資訊系統，透過系統整合與優化，提供一致性介面與便於使用者存取方式，提升查詢效率、使用體驗，並確保未來擴充性與維護的便利性，以更符合現代化需求。
> This project aims to unify and improve the student information system by integrating different systems into a single, easy-to-use platform. It will provide a consistent interface, improve search efficiency, enhance user experience, and ensure easier future upgrades and maintenance to meet modern needs.

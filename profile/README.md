# DyuOhin1 [Work In Process]

#### 因應「大葉之行」與「大葉行動家」兩款學生可使用的手機應用程式下架，本專案因此誕生。  
To address the discontinuation of "大葉之行" and "大葉行動家," the only two mobile apps available for students at DaYeh University, this project was created.

#### 我們的目標是打造一款擁有更友善、更簡潔操作介面的應用程式，並致力於整合大葉大學學生日常所需的大部分服務。  
Our goal is to develop an application with a more user-friendly and streamlined interface while integrating most of the daily services needed by DaYeh University students.
